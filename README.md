# "Azure DevOps Pipeline with Jenkins for Automated CI/CD Deployment"
This project demonstrates the creation of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Azure and Docker. The pipeline is designed to build and deploy a Dockerized application to Azure App Services upon any code changes in a GitHub repository.

# The project include:
  Automated CI Process: Jenkins pulls the latest code, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to Azure Container Registry (ACR) upon each commit.
  
  Automated CD Process: The Docker image is then automatically deployed to Azure App Services, ensuring the latest version of the application is always live.
  
  Azure Integration: Seamless integration with Azure through service principals, enabling secure and efficient deployments.
  
  Scalability: This setup can be easily adapted for different applications or environments, providing a robust foundation for cloud-native CI/CD pipelines.

After completing all the configurations, the application can be accessed and used directly in a browser, reflecting any changes made in the GitHub repository through the automated CI/CD pipeline.

After going to the site, you will be able to see the application window:
